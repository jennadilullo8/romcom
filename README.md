## About

In this project, an application was created where the user could make a RomCom cover with a randomly selected image, title, and descriptors. That cover could then be saved if the user liked it as such. The user could also make their own cover with their own image, title, and descriptors. The user could then save the cover and see it in their saved Rom Com. If the user did not like that saved RomCom cover, they then could delete it.
