## About

In this project, an application was created where the user could make a RomCom cover with a randomly selected image, title, and descriptors. That cover could then be saved if the user liked it as such. The user could also make their own cover with their own image, title, and descriptors. The user could then save the cover and see it in their saved Rom Coms section. If the user did not like that saved RomCom cover, they then could delete it.

## Learning Goals

 - Write clean, DRY JavaScript to store our data
 - Use a provided class by creating object instances using the new keyword
 - Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
 - Understand event bubbling and use event delegation on dynamic elements
 - Begin to understand how to write effective, clean HTML & CSS
 - Consistently make commits and use proper git flow

## Wins

 - Developing a good understanding of how query selectors and event handlers work together
 - Creating functionality when the user clicks on a button

## Challenges

 - Understanding which html elements we need for the DOM.
 - Solving merge conflicts

## Technologies Used

 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript
 - Git/GitHub
